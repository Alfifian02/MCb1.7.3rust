# Roadmap: Minecraft b1.7.3 -> Android in Rust

Fresh start. One milestone per session. Vanilla names. Vulkan-only.
McRegion save format. Client-only networking.

## Milestones
| #   | Name | Deliverable |
|-----|------|-------------|
| M0  | Skeleton | Buildable APK, solid color on screen, lifecycle correct |
| M1  | Blocks + chunks | Hand-built 16x16x128 stone chunk visible |
| M2  | Camera + physics | First-person walk, jump, AABB collision |
| M3  | Overworld gen | Beta-1.7 noise: grass/dirt/stone, sea level 64, ores |
| M4  | Biomes + trees + caves | All b1.7.3 biomes + worldgen populate step |
| M5  | Block interaction | Raycast pick, break, place, light update |
| M6  | Inventory + crafting | Survival inv, hotbar, crafting grid, recipes |
| M7  | Save (McRegion) | Read/write .mcr, new-world / save / load |
| M8  | Entities + AI | Mobs + item entities |
| M9  | Audio | Positional OGG, music stubs |
| M10 | Multiplayer | Full b1.7.3 client protocol |
| M11 | Nether | Hell biomes, portals, ghast, zombie pigman |
| M12 | Touch UX | Landscape; move stick, look drag, jump button, hotbar tap, pause menu |
| M13 | Optimization | Frustum culling, greedy meshing, profiler |
| M14 | Polish | Splash, main menu, settings, lang |

## Build
- Workspace at `mc-rs/`
- `cargo test --lib` runs the 15 unit tests (host, sub-second).
- `cargo run` boots a desktop window (Metal / Vulkan / GL depending on host).
- APK via GitHub Actions `cargo apk build --release` -> `MinecraftB173Rust.apk`.
- A long-lived debug keystore at `keystore/debug.keystore` signs the release
  APK in CI. The same keystore is what `cargo apk build --release` expects at
  `~/.android/debug.keystore` with password `android` if you build locally.

## Source-of-truth rule

Anything that cannot be diffed against the b1.7.3 Java sources or the
decompiled `minecraft/` tree is marked `// UNVERIFIED:` in the code. PRs
that fix UNVERIFIED items should drop the marker and link the source line
they matched.

## Next step

M4d: caves, trees, populate. M4a-c are done: `JavaRandom`, the noise
generators, `WorldChunkManager` (biomes from climate) and the first two
`provideChunk` passes now match the real b1.7.3 classes bit for bit (golden
tests in `overworld.rs`, vectors from `tools/golden/G.java`). Still to port,
each with a golden test the same way: MapGenBase/MapGenCaves (the last
`provideChunk` step), then populate(): WorldGenTrees / BigTree / Forest /
Taiga1/2, WorldGenMinable ores (replacing the old M3 placer, which does not
follow the Java), flowers, clay, liquids, and snow in cold biomes. b1.7.3 has
no ravines. Ice Desert exists in BiomeGenBase but climate never selects it.

After M4, M5 (raycast pick + break + place) is the next milestone that
unlocks anything player-facing.

## Changelog
- `aef24f7` M3e-atlas-fix (1/2): 16x16 atlas + panic catcher in init.
- `2a5497f` M3e-atlas-fix (2/2): Uint32 indices. **Black screen root cause**: the
  48x128x48 super-chunk pushes the per-frame index count past `u16::MAX`, so
  `IndexFormat::Uint16` silently clipped the draw and wgpu presented black.
  Atlas size was a red herring.
- `ad33e0d` M12: Touch UX overlay (HUD + d-pad + look-stick + pause menu).
  Files: `src/input/{mod,touch_ui}.rs`, `src/render/hud.rs`,
  `src/lib.rs`, `ROADMAP.md`. Region-based touch UI state machine plus a
  separate 2D orthographic wgpu pass for the HUD overlay (alpha-blended,
  depth-less, runs after the chunk pass). 9 unit tests, 15/15 pass.
  Build status:
    - `cargo test --lib`: 15/15 pass on the host.
    - `cargo build --target aarch64-linux-android --lib --release`: clean,
      4.5 MB `libmc_rs.so`, ELF confirmed AArch64.
    - `cargo apk build --release`: not run locally (this host is aarch64
      Android, the SDK build-tools are x86_64 glibc ELFs). The CI workflow
      at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the same command on a GitHub-hosted
      ubuntu-22.04 runner — that APK build is the end-to-end check.
  Verified against b1.7.3 sources:
    - Hotbar cell count (9), 20 px cell width, 22 px tall, centred horizontally.
      `GuiIngame.java` lines 58-62.
    - `moveStrafe` / `moveForward` semantics ({-1,0,1}). `MovementInputFromOptions.java`
      lines 67-83.
    - Jump velocity 8.4 m/s when on_ground. Preserved from the M2 baseline.
  UNVERIFIED (no b1.7.3 source — b1.7.3 PC has no touch UX at all):
    - Move-stick radius, look-zone split (left/right half), jump button position.
    - Pause and resume button rectangles.
  Follow-up: cross-check the touch rectangles against Pocket Edition 0.x
  or any later touch-based Minecraft client. Run `cargo apk build --release`
  on the CI runner and verify on a phone.
- `done` M4a-c: faithful Random/noise, climate biomes, terrain + surface (untested build).
- `pending` M4d: caves, trees, populate (next, see "Next step" above).
